Backing bean class: Jsf23ViewBean, Scope class: javax.faces.view.ViewScoped

Info:   StatefulRequest  [1516009460856]: preDestroy

Note that the @PostConstruct is NOT invoked again on the already-existent 
@Stateless session beans - but the exec() is. We can see from the pseudoState 
counter that we are getting already-used stateless session beans via the pool.

Note that the @PostConstruct is NOT invoked again on the already-existent explicitly 
@SessionScoped @Stateful session bean - but the exec() is - and @PreDestroy is 
likewise NOT yet invoked.

Note that the @RequestScoped @Stateful session bean had @PreDestroy automatically invoked
(and this happens even though @PreDestroy has not been invoked on the backing bean).


NEXT: Case1: Leave the page with the h:commandButton with an action method (with Mojarra-2.3 
GET-related navigation methods don’t unload the view-scoped beans well):

Info:   Jsf23ViewBean    [1516009460851]: actionDone

Info:   Jsf23ViewBean    [1516009460851]: SKIP: DO NOT force remove() on @Inject statefulRequest !

Info:   Jsf23ViewBean    [1516009460851]: SKIP: DO NOT force remove() on @Inject statefulSession !
Info:   StatefulOmniView [1516009460860]: preDestroy

Note however that the @Stateful session bean with no explicit scope (class StatefulInject)
and the @Stateful session bean with explicit @Dependent pseudo-scope (class StatefulDepend)
DO NOT have their @PreDestroy invoked by the container !

@PreDestroy is also not invoked but the container for the @Stateful session bean
that was injected with @EJB (class StatefulEjb). This is consistent and expected.

NEXT: Case2: Stay on the page instead with the h:commandButton with an action method with ‘null’ return.
(To do this you have to load the page view again, and the timestamps will of course be mostly different.)

The sequence then looks like:

Info:   StatefulEjb      [1516009951544]: postConstruct
Info:   StatefulInject   [1516009951545]: postConstruct
Info:   StatefulDepend   [1516009951546]: postConstruct

Info:   StatelessInject  [1516008112539]: pseudoState=13
Info:   StatefulRequest  [1516009951549]: preDestroy

And on “staying”:

Info:   Jsf23ViewBean    [1516009951544]: actionNull

NEXT: Case3: Much as for GET-related navigation, browser reload 
is BROKEN for @ViewScoped under Mojarra-2.3: RESULTS OMITTED.
